title: Learning Topos Theory
---

*Last updated: 11th January 2020*

I want to learn Topos Theory as a first venture into categorical/categorial logic. My current understanding of the motivation for topos theory is that its a means of generalising/swapping out the models of a mathematical theory, which is usually occupied by set theory. I'm particularly intrigued about the connection between geometry and logic.
