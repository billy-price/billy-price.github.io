I'm a mathematics student living in Melbourne, Australia, currently attending the [The University of Mebourne](https://unimelb.edu.au). My interests are pure mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science (especially the theories which lie at the intersection of these topics). This website serves as a place for collecting notes, posts, and links on topics I'm currently interested in.
