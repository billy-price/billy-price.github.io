Master's student in mathematics at Utrecht University (Logic Track), and chief software engineer/co-founder of [metauni](https://metauni.org/). I'm interested in productive high-level abstractions that allow you to keep your feet on the ground, both in programming and proofs.

## Projects
- [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard): Shared virtual blackboards in Roblox. I am the primary author and maintainer. These are the key instrument for delivering seminars in Roblox. Embedding information in a persistent, virtual space with metaboards is a powerful framework for collaboration and research, not possible with other shared whiteboards tools.

- [metauniOS](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard): monorepo for the modules that make up metauni. I designed the overall structure and module loading, and have made major contributions to the Orbcam, AdminCommands and Drone systems.

- [Feather](https://github.com/blinkybool/feather): A featherweight declarative instance manager for Roblox. Made to dramatically increase the memory efficiency of metaboard.

- [Replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4dfwxzXEFM): Multi-channel recordings of speaker audio, writing on metaboards, and motion capture of a VR character. WIP, but some code can be found [here](https://github.com/metauni/ReplayUtils)

## Foundations

I organise and host the [Foundations seminar](https://metauni.org/posts/events/seminar-foundations) with [Will Troiani](https://williamtroiani.github.io) on the nature of mathematical objects, logic and Gödel's theorems at [metauni](https://metauni.org/).
