Hi there, I'm Billy.
I like mathematics, logic and theoretical computer science, and enjoy mixing them together. Check the tab at the top right for my research.

## Foundations

I organise and host the [Foundations seminar](https://metauni.org/posts/events/seminar-foundations) with [Will Troiani](https://williamtroiani.github.io) on the nature of mathematical objects, logic and Gödel's theorems at [metauni](https://metauni.org/).

## metauni

What is [metauni](https://metauni.org/)? 
> Metauni is a community of scholars in the Metaverse, with 3D virtual environment and voice chat provided by Roblox and whiteboards and other open source tools scripted in Luau.

I am developing the open-source project [metaboard](https://github.com/metauni/metaboard), which enables us to use blackboards in Roblox for delivering lectures and doing day-to-day mathematics research, all within a shared 3D environment.
